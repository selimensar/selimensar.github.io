## When I was in Istanbul

 I entered the digital world in 2017 by establishing a website called [voxmedya.com](https://voxmedya.com/) in Turkish. We have published blog posts and interviews about digital marketing on this website. Thanks to this website, I started working in a digital marketing consultancy agency in 2018. I worked in this agency for 1 year and 7 months.

## After moving to Brussels

I have moved to Brussels in January 2020. After moving to Brussels, I set up a new website called [marketingcoder.com](https://marketingcoder.com/) to explain what I know in English.

Also,  I started improving myself on **_Front-End Development_**, which I have been interested in for years. What have I done about Front-End:

* I finished the course called ["Advanced CSS and Sass: Flexbox, Grid, Animations and More!"](https://www.udemy.com/course/advanced-css-and-sass/)
* During this course, I uploaded the designs I wrote with SASS (gulp) to my github account via git.
* After the course, I coded a home page designed in Figma with Sass (gulp) and uploaded it to github.
